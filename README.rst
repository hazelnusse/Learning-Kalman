Learning Kalman
===============

I am slowly learning about Kalman filtering by working through example problems
from the following two books:

1.  "Applied Optimal Estimation", Arthur Gelb (editor), The M.I.T. Press, 1974
2.  "Kalman Filtering: Theory & Practice Using MATLAB", Mohinder S. Grewal,
    Wiley-IEEE Press, 3rd edition, 2008

I am going to try to do as much as I can using Python's scientific tools, but I
may have to end up using Matlab for some things.  At first, I'll just create
simple scripts for each example which should generate plots and illustrate how
to implement the math behind the filter.
