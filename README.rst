Learning Kalman
===============

I am slowly learning about Kalman filtering by working through example problems
from the following two books:

1.  "Applied Optimal Estimation", Arthur Gelb (editor), 1974
2.  "Kalman Filtering: Theory & Practice Usint MATLAB", Mohinder S. Grewal,
    2008

I am going to try to do as much as I can using Python's scientific tools, but I
may have to end up using Matlab for some things.
